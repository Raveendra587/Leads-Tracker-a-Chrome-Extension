# Leads Tracker

I have built a Chrome extension Leads Tracker to track and save GitHub profiles, LinkedIn profiles and useful website addresses for faster access and connection.

## Let's see how to deploy your project as an extension in Chrome

  ### Follow these steps
  * Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) page
  * On the top right corner enable the button **developer mode**
  * On the top left corner you will have the **Load unpacked** button click on it and load the project folder.
  * Now your project is successfully loaded as a Chrome extension
  * Check out your extension in the Chrome extensions folder.
